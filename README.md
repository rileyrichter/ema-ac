# EMA AC 2020

This is a repository to hold custom code used for the Enrollment Management Association Conference website. You can find [the website here](https://ac.enrollment.org/).

The site was built in [Webflow](https://webflow.com) and the backend runs on [Memberstack](https://www.memberstack.io/), [Zapier](https://zapier.com), and [Airtable](https://airtable.com).

The code here serves two small functions:

1. Code to pass values from an input to a success state of a form.
2. Code to validate passwords and fire an interaction if the pw's match/don't match. Props to [Finsweet](https://www.finsweethacks.com/34).
3. Code to add the current selector to the On-Demand menu item depending on the directory.

Other code used for this project lives in the private repository.

All files served via [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/).
